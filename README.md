# CVD Detection Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks related to the development and fine-tuning of a Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) detection model using deep learning techniques.

## Contents

1. [Cardio_Vas_Preprocessing.ipynb](Cardio_Vas_Preprocessing.ipynb) - Data preprocessing steps for the CVD detection project.
2. [Final_Model.ipynb](Final_Model.ipynb) - Implementation of the final model.
3. [Final_Model_with_HyperParametertuning.ipynb](Final_Model_with_HyperParametertuning.ipynb) - Hyperparameter tuning for the final model.
4. [Finetuning_Modeland_HeatMap.ipynb](Finetuning_Modeland_HeatMap.ipynb) - Fine-tuning the model and generating heatmaps for model interpretability.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MightyManjaly/Datascience_Project.git
    cd Datascience_Project
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook).

3. Follow the instructions within each notebook to run the code and understand the workflow.
